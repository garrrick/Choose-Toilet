# Choose-Toilet 

How to choose the best (most clean) toilet when there are lots of (e.g. 300) toilets during a festival?

Short answer: choose the toilet at about 36.8% of all toilets, you will have the highest probability 0.368 to get the best toilet.

This is just a practice for me to get familiar with Github, For better understanding, please watch this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIOoCKO-ybQ).

Demo scenario: 300 toilets to choose, 10000 simulations
