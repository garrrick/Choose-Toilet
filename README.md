Mathematical problem simulation

Unconstrained function minimization in javascript.

This package implements some basic numerical optimization algorithms: Nelder-Mead, Gradient
Descent, Wolf Line Search and Non-Linear Conjugate Gradient methods are all provided.

Interactive visualizations with D3 explaining how these algorithms work are also included in this package.
Descriptions of the algorithms as well as most of the visualizations are available on my blog post
[An Interactive Tutorial on Numerical Optimization](https://terra.snellman.net).
