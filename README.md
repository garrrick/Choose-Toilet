# Choose-Toilet

You are in a festival at a big park and you want to go to a toilet because you are drinking too much.
There are lots of (e.g. 300) toilets, you see the first one and it is a mess, then you check second toilet, this toilet is better but you still would like to check another toilet, you are continuing checking and some toilets are even worse but some are even better. You can check all 300 toilets and choose the best toilet, but you don't have much time to do that.

A question comes up to you: How to find the best (most clean) toilet without checking all toilets?

Short answer: Check first 36.8% of all toilets, then continue checking, when you find the next toilet that is better then previous 36.8% toilets, this toilet will have the highest probability 0.368 that you get the best toilet.

This is just a practice for me to get familiar with Github, For better understanding, please watch this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIOoCKO-ybQ).
